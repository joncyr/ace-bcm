Technical Contact: Ken Son <kson@dar.fm>
Data Documentation: "DARfm Data Description.txt"
Documentation source: e-mail 10-24.2014 from Ken Son

Files are served via http from http://data.dar.fm/ using username/password authentication

Files fetched via wget called from fab

Files are gzipped sql files
Files are raw mysql backups, one file per week
Files are loaded by piping the compressed files into a mysql command line interpreter
Data is batch converted into postgres via py-mysql2pgsql

postgres database name: 'darfm'

tables loaded: stationsongctrl (complete refresh every week), songlist (append records each week)

database structure created via py-mysql2pgsql

indexes are created using sql script pgsql_create_darfm_indices.sql

Create DARfm databases from nothing:

as user postgres, create user and database for postgres

createuser updateusername
createdb darfm
psql -c "grant all on database darfm to updateusername"
psql -c "alter user updateusername password 'updateuserpassword'"

as any user, create database and user for mysql

mysql -u root -h feeds-useast1b.dev.bosecm.com -e "create user dbagent"
mysql -u root -h feeds-useast1b.dev.bosecm.com -e "set password for dbagent= password('HelloWorldHowAreYou')"
mysql -u root -h feeds-useast1b.dev.bosecm.com -e "create database darfm"
mysql -u root -h feeds-useast1b.dev.bosecm.com -e "grant all privileges on *.* to dbagent@localhost"

As user updateusername:

fab feeds.importDARfm.dev feeds.importDARfm.create_darfmdb_schema
fab feeds.importDARfm.dev feeds.importDARfm.load_darfm_incremental
PGOPTIONS='-c maintenance_work_mem=1GB' psql darfm < pgsql_create_darfm_indices.sql

Other notes:
	Database names and credentials are hardcoded in the fab file and the .yml files in the scripts directory
	Authentication credentials are hardcoded in the fab file (dar_user.dar_password)
	Incremental data feeds are weekly on Monday morning.
	Feed should be finished at 4am Pacific (7am eastern) there have been issues with delivery times.
	We run updates on Tuesdays.
	Feeds are UTF-8 encoded, this changed from latin1 mid-2014
	Do not re-run an incremental date that has already run, it results in duplicate data
