The JSON messages that are in the queue for the Rovi daily update logging are formatted as follows:

{  
   "dataset":"rovi",
   "logdate":"yymmdd",
   "tables":{  
      "tablename":{  
         "insert":[  
            array of insert keys
         ],
         "update":[  
            array of update keys
         ],
         "delete":[  
            array of delete keys
         ]
      }
   }
}


The keys are the primary keys for the Rovi table, tablename for each table updated. The logdate is the date for the update applied, not the date of processing.
